I enjoy teaching and mentoring students. In 2024, I was awarded the *Dean's Award for Teaching Excellence* at EPFL.

#### Courses taught at EPFL

**Statistical Physics II** (2023, 2024)

Advanced course on statistical physics focusing on phase transitions, critical phenomena, and the renormalization group, for third-year Physics students.

**Machine Learning for Physicists** (2021, 2022, 2023)

An introduction to machine learning with scientific applications for MSc students in Physics and Chemistry.

**Physics Projects I: Statistical Mechanics of Deep Learning** (2021)

Theoretical and computational research projects on neural networks for first-year MSc students specializing in Physics and Applied Physics.

In Spring 2024, I also served as a guest lecturer for CS-625 *Transfer Learning and Meta-Learning*.
