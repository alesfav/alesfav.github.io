I enjoy teaching and mentoring. In 2024, I was awarded the *Dean's Award for Teaching Excellence* at EPFL.

#### Statistical Physics II

##### 2023, 2024

Advanced course on statistical physics focusing on phase transitions, critical phenomena, and the renormalization group, for third-year Physics students.

#### Machine Learning for Physicists

##### 2021, 2022, 2023

An introduction to machine learning with scientific applications for MSc students in Physics and Chemistry.

#### Physics Projects I: Statistical Mechanics of Deep Learning

##### 2021

Theoretical and computational research projects on neural networks for first-year MSc students specializing in Physics and Applied Physics.

In Spring 2024, I was also a guest lecturer for CS-625 *Transfer Learning and Meta-Learning*.
