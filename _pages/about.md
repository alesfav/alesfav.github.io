Iâ€™m an inaugural Physics-AI Fellow at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/). 

My research seeks to advance the fundamental understanding of **artificial intelligence**, often drawing on methods from **statistical physics** and **complex systems** theory. A primary focus of my work is to elucidate the intrinsic **structure of data**, such as language and images, and to understand how generative models build **internal representations** of this structure. I'm also interested in leveraging these foundational insights to accelerate **scientific discovery**.

Previously, I completed my PhD in the physics of learning and AI at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) (Switzerland), advised by Matthieu Wyart and Pascal Frossard. My academic background is in the physics of complex systems, with studies at [Sorbonne](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en), [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/en), [SISSA](https://www.sissa.it/), and [ICTP](https://www.ictp.it/). I've also spent time as an Applied Scientist Intern with the Fundamental Research team at [Amazon's AWS AI Labs](https://aws.amazon.com/) in the Bay Area.
