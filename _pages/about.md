`I'm on the job market for the academic year 2025/2026!`

Hey there! I’m a final-year PhD student at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), where I’m advised by [Matthieu Wyart](https://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu/directory/matthieu-wyart/) and [Pascal Frossard](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lts4/people/people-current/frossard/). During my PhD, I also interned as an applied scientist at Amazon’s [AWS AI Labs](https://aws.amazon.com/), working in [Stefano Soatto](https://www.amazon.science/author/stefano-soatto)’s group.

My research is driven by understanding the fundamental principles that underpin the success of artificial intelligence. Currently, my work focuses on:
- Studying how learnability is affected by [geometric properties of training data](#), such as symmetries, hierarchical, and compositional structures that are prevalent in images and language.
- Post-training and multi-modal aspects of [foundation models](#), with a focus on understanding and enhancing [model editing](#) and [model merging](#) techniques.

These directions are both connected by the need to characterize the [internal representations of data](#) built by neural networks.

Prior to my PhD, I completed a joint Master’s degree in [theoretical physics](#) from Sorbonne Université, Politecnico di Torino, SISSA, and ICTP.
