`I'm on the job market for the academic year 2025-2026!`

Hey there! I’m a final-year PhD student at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), where I’m advised by [Matthieu Wyart](https://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu/directory/matthieu-wyart/) and [Pascal Frossard](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lts4/people/people-current/frossard/). During my PhD, I was also fortunate to intern as an applied scientist at Amazon’s [AWS AI Labs](https://aws.amazon.com/) with [Stefano Soatto](https://www.amazon.science/author/stefano-soatto)’s team.

My research is aimed at understanding and improving modern **artificial intelligence** systems. My current work focuses on scientific aspects of **diffusion and generative models**. In particular I study how they learn and represent the geometric **structure of data**, using toy models of images and language to gain theoretical insights. Moreover, I work on **post-training modeling strategies** to edit neural representations of large models to improve alignment and model merging.

Prior to my PhD, I completed a joint Master’s degree in **theoretical physics** from Sorbonne Université, Politecnico di Torino, SISSA, and ICTP.
