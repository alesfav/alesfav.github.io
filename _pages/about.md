I’m a final-year PhD student at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) in Switzerland, working with [Matthieu Wyart](https://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu/directory/matthieu-wyart/) and [Pascal Frossard](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lts4/people/people-current/frossard/). **This fall, I will join the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) as a Research Associate and *Physics-AI Fellow*.**

My research aims to deepen the scientific understanding of **AI and deep learning**, often drawing on methods from **statistical physics**. I am currently focused on generative models -- in particular, continuous and discrete **diffusion models** -- and the science of **post-training**, including large-scale model editing and merging.

Previously, I interned as an Applied Scientist in the Fundamental Research team at [Amazon's AWS AI Labs](https://aws.amazon.com/) in the Bay Area, and completed my studies in **theoretical physics** at Sorbonne, Politecnico di Torino, SISSA, and ICTP.
