Iâ€™m an inaugural Physics-AI Fellow at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/). 

My research aims to advance the fundamental understanding of **artificial intelligence**, often drawing on methods from **statistical physics** and the study of **complex systems**. I currently focus on the **structure of data** -- such as that of language and images -- and on generative AI, particularly **diffusion models**. I'm also interested in the role of AI in **scientific discovery**.

Previously, I completed my PhD at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) (Switzerland), advised by Matthieu Wyart and Pascal Frossard. My academic background is in the physics of complex systems, with studies at Sorbonne, Politecnico di Torino, SISSA, and ICTP. I've also spent time as an Applied Scientist Intern with the Fundamental Research team at [Amazon's AWS AI Labs](https://aws.amazon.com/) in the Bay Area.
